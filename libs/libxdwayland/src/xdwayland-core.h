* 
* Surface contents are double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.
* 
* The initial surface contents are void; there is no content.

* will not access the pixels anymore, it will send the

* attached and then replaced by another attach instead of committed
* will not receive a release event, and is not used by the

* 
* If a pending wl_buffer has been committed to more than one wl_surface,

* from the same backing storage or use a protocol extension providing

* is allowed as long as the underlying buffer storage isn't re-used (this

* destroys the wl_buffer before receiving the wl_buffer.release event and
* mutates the underlying buffer storage, the surface contents become
* undefined immediately.

* 
* When multiple wl_pointer.axis events occur within the same frame,

* When a wl_pointer.axis and a wl_pointer.axis_stop event occur within
* the same frame, this indicates that axis movement in one axis has
* stopped but continues in the other axis.
* When multiple wl_pointer.axis_stop events occur within the same

* Specifically, a client may get a sequence: motion, frame, button,

* 
* The wl_pointer.enter and wl_pointer.leave events are logical events
* generated by the compositor and not the hardware. These events are
* also grouped by a wl_pointer.frame. When a pointer moves from one
* surface to another, a compositor should group the
* wl_pointer.leave event within the same wl_pointer.frame.
* However, a client must not rely on wl_pointer.leave and
* wl_pointer.enter being in the same wl_pointer.frame.
* Compositor-specific policies may require the wl_pointer.leave and

* or may not be sent. Whether a compositor sends an axis_stop event
* for these sources is hardware-specific and implementation-dependent;
* clients must not rely on receiving an axis_stop event for these
* scroll sources and should treat scroll sequences from these scroll
* sources as unterminated by default.
* 
* This event is optional. If the source is unknown for a particular

* sent to clients supporting version 8 or later.
* 
* This event does not occur on its own, it is coupled with a

/* axis relative physical direction event
* 
* Relative directional information of the entity causing the axis
* motion.
* 
* For a wl_pointer.axis event, the wl_pointer.axis_relative_direction
* event specifies the movement direction of the entity causing the
* wl_pointer.axis event. For example:
* - if a user's fingers on a touchpad move down and this
* causes a wl_pointer.axis vertical_scroll down event, the physical
* direction is 'identical'
* - if a user's fingers on a touchpad move down and this causes a
* wl_pointer.axis vertical_scroll up scroll up event ('natural
* scrolling'), the physical direction is 'inverted'.
* 
* A client may use this information to adjust scroll motion of
* components. Specifically, enabling natural scrolling causes the
* content to change direction compared to traditional scrolling.
* Some widgets like volume control sliders should usually match the
* physical direction regardless of whether natural scrolling is
* active. This event enables clients to match the scroll direction of
* a widget to the physical direction.
* 
* This event does not occur on its own, it is coupled with a

* The protocol guarantees that each axis_relative_direction event is
